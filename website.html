<p>I dont like syntax issues because they are annoying and spelling is very picky. Websites are really good in some ways because they share alot of the information about important topics
they are also really bad because they can expose big global issues on very sensitve topics such as terrorism. Websites can also be used to access peoples bank accounts seeing as most peoples banking is all done online. Some Examples of websites are:</p>
<li>
1. Banking
2. Social Media
3. News
